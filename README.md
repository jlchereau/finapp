# FinApp

A Financial Portfolio Optimization Application





## Notes:

- use `make install` to install dev requirements
- use `make build` to compile the application without running it.
- use `make run` to compile and launch the application

- use `lsof -i :3000` and `lsof -i :8000` to find PIDs of running processes
- use `kill -9 <PID>`to kill each process when necessary as they might not close properly between runs
