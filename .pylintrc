# Per-file ignores for test files to handle legitimate pytest patterns
# that are not applicable to production code quality standards
per-file-ignores =
    tests/**:protected-access,redefined-outer-name,attribute-defined-outside-init,reimported,unused-argument,broad-exception-caught

# Justification for each disabled message in test files:
# - protected-access: Tests need to access private methods/attributes for thorough testing
# - redefined-outer-name: Pytest fixtures commonly redefine names from outer scopes (fixture pattern)
# - attribute-defined-outside-init: Pytest setup_method pattern defines attributes outside __init__
# - reimported: Test isolation often requires reimporting modules within fixtures for clean state
# - unused-argument: Pytest fixtures may be passed but not directly used in test logic (dependency injection)
# - broad-exception-caught: Workflow/exception testing legitimately catches general Exception types

# IMPORTANT: Disabling messages for app/**/* files should be made inline.
# `pylint: disable=*` comments hide issues, so they should only be considered
# a last resort options if all attempts to fix the code have failed.
